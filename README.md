# Data-Science---Twitch

“Twitch is the world’s leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation. Its live and on-demand video platform forms the backbone of a distribution network for video game broadcasters including professional players, tournaments, leagues, developers and gaming media organizations.”

    -Codecademy 

This project is part of the Codecademy course on data science. In this project, I answered questions using two related tables that describe user engagement with Twitch video and chat. I analyzed data with SQL and used Python and Matplotlib to create visualizations. The following files are:

1.	Twitch Visualization – It contains my final analysis with graphs and charts in a presentation form. 	This file contains the code written in Python.

2.	Twitch Analysis (Excel file) – It contains my detailed analysis in tables and graphs forms.

3.	SQL file – Contains my queries used in generating the data to be analyzed.


**Note** that the actual data used is not available. The SQL file contains the programming code used to create the queries. Also the data is scrubbed and is meant for practice use only.
