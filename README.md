# Data-Science---Twitch
This project is part of the Codecademy course on data science. In this project, I answered questions using two related tables that describe user engagement with Twitch video and chat. I analyzed data with SQL and used Python and Matplotlib to create visualizations. The following files are:

1.	Twitch Visualization – It contains my final analysis with graphs and charts in a presentation form.

2. 	Twitch Data Analysis Images - It includes images used in the twitch visualization file.
3.	Twitch Analysis (Excel file) – It contains my detailed analysis in tables and graphs forms.
4.	SQL file – Contains my queries used in generating the data to be analyzed. 
5.	Database file (.db) – Contains the actual data. Contains two tables, one for chat and stream. 
6. 	Chat and Stream (.csv) – These two files were imported into the database file (.db).

**Note:** that the database file (.db) can be opened by using the "DB Browser." Then you can copy and paste the queries file (SQL file) in the "Execute SQL" tab of the "DB Browser" to see the results of each query.
